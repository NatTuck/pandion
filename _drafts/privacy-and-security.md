# Privacy and Security

## Intro

Apple claims that the [iPhone is more secure than Android phones](

Mozilla claims that Firefox is more secure than Google Chrome.




Which device or software is a better choice if you value your privacy and security?

 - An iPhone, or an old Android device with a Google-free custom ROM?
 - Mozilla Firefox, or a fork like GNU Icecat?

To seriously answer this question, it's nessiary to look at what security and
privacy actually are in some detail. Because there are two answers to these
questions, and one of them has a pretty serious problem.

## What are privacy and security?

Computer security consists of mechanisms, usually implemented in software, to
enforce security rules. Security rules define who can control computer systems
and access data stored in them.

For example, if you set a PIN on your phone then software on the phone enforces
a rule that only people who know the PIN can unlock your phone to run apps or
make phone calls.

Privacy, then, is a set of security rules that ensures that data that you want
to keep private stays private. This nessisarily implies some other security
rules, e.g. a rule that someone who shouldn't have access to your data can't
change your privacy settings.

Any time we're talking about rules, there are some essential questions to ask:

 * What are the rules?
 * What should the rules be?
 * Who makes the rules?
 * Who can change the rules? How? When?

Determining which thing will best protect your security and privacy seems like a
pretty simple problem: you can just consider the first two questions. Whichever
option has rules closest to the ideal is the better one. Unfortunately,
sometimes rules can change. And in that case things become more complicated.

## Who makes the rules?

From a technical perspective, the answer to this question is simple: The
programmers who build the systems make the rules. If the programmers work for a
company, then the company management may decide what the rules should be.





   
 * Real world security tends to be partial. You can open a locked door
   without a key if you're willing to break it down, or if you know
   how to pick locks.
 * Computer security tends to be binary, either some security property holds
   completely or it doesn't.
 * Privacy is a set of security properties: people can only access your data
   if you give it to them.
