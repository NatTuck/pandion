# Privacy and Security

Mozilla and Apple have recently claimed in their marketing that their products
protect your privacy better than their competition. Is that true? What does
"privacy" actually mean in this context?

Apple produces phones. Mozilla develops a web browser. Today we do pretty much
everything through one or both of those things. They therefore have the
opportunity to seriously compromise our privacy if they aren't designed to
protect it.

In order for a device or piece of software to respect your privacy it needs to
avoid sharing private data with anyone unless you explicitly intend to share
that data with that recipient.

No software or device that communicates with the outside world can protect your
privacy perfectly. Cell phones constantly transmit your location to your service
provider as an unavoidable side effect of the way cellular networks work. Web
browsers transmit packets over the internet that include the address of their
destitination, and every router those packets visit must have access to that
address.



## Notes

 * Security is about control: who can do what?
 * Computer security allows rules to be automatically enforced.
   * You can only log in to an account if you know the correct password.
   * You can only decrypt the email if you have the correct private key.
   * Instant messages are only delivered to the intended recipient.
 * Digital privacy can be looked at as a bunch of these security rules that
   restrict access to various kinds of personal information.
   * A key aspect of privacy is keeping secrets. The way to do that is
     simple: don't tell anyone your secrets.
     

If security and privacy are just sets of rules, then there's an obvious and
essential question: Who makes the rules?

From a technical perspective, the answer to this question is simple: The
programmers who build the systems make the rules. In practice it's a little more
complicated. There are two other common cases to consider:

 * The programmers work for a company, and the company management decide what
   the rules should be.
 * The programmers don't really think through what they're doing, and the rules
   that end up being implemented are simply an accident.





   
 * Real world security tends to be partial. You can open a locked door
   without a key if you're willing to break it down, or if you know
   how to pick locks.
 * Computer security tends to be binary, either some security property holds
   completely or it doesn't.
 * Privacy is a set of security properties: people can only access your data
   if you give it to them.
