# Privacy and Security

 * Security is about control: who can do what?
 * Computer security allows rules to be automatically enforced.
   * You can only log in to an account if you know the correct password.
   * You can only decrypt the email if you have the correct private key.
   * Instant messages are only delivered to the intended recipient.
 * Digital privacy is just a bunch of these security rules that restrict
   access to various kinds of personal information.

If security and privacy are just sets of rules, then there's an obvious and
essential question: Who makes the rules?

From a technical perspective, the answer to this question is simple: The
programmers who build the systems make the rules. In practice it's a little more
complicated. There are two other common cases to consider:

 * The programmers work for a company, and the company management decide what
   the rules should be.
 * The programmers don't really think through what they're doing, and the rules
   that end up being implemented are simply an accident.





   
 * Real world security tends to be partial. You can open a locked door
   without a key if you're willing to break it down, or if you know
   how to pick locks.
 * Computer security tends to be binary, either some security property holds
   completely or it doesn't.
 * Privacy is a set of security properties: people can only access your data
   if you give it to them.
