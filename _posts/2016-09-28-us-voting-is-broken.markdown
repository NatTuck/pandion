problems -- it's so broken that calling the United States democratic is simply
false advertising.

The process is broken at every level, and when viewed from every angle.

## The Ideal of the Republic

Optimal: Direct Democracy

Too much work. Compromise: Representitives

## Political Parties

 - The US system was not designed for political parties at all.
 - When we add parties, we get a stable outcome of two dominant parties.
 - This means that two private clubs get to pick the two candidates for
   each office.
 - This moves basically *all* the political influence from voting to
   club partitipation.

## Presidential Election

 - Electoral college ("red state", "blue state")
 - First-past-the-post

## The Standard Voting Protocol

 - Polling stations
 - Polling booths
 - Paper ballots
 - Ballot boxes
 - Election observers
 - Hand counting
 - Recount mechanism

## Broken Alternate Systems

 - Vote by Mail
 - Pre-voting
 - Electronic ballot counting
 - Voting machines that produce paper ballots
 - Direct-recording electronic voting machines

## Complexity and Broad Understanding

## Media Coverage

 - First-past-the-post leads to strategic voting based on determining
   the top-2 candidates before voting occurs.
 - For the general election, this is the top two parties.
 - For primaries, this is the top two of several options.
 - People use media coverage to determine the top two.
 - Therefore - especially in primaries - media coverage has a larger
   effect selecting the winner than voting does.
