A '''thought-terminating [[cliché]]''' is a commonly used phrase, sometimes passing as folk wisdom, used to propagate [[cognitive dissonance]] (discomfort experienced when one simultaneously holds two or more conflicting cognitions, e.g. ideas, beliefs, values or emotional reactions).  Though the phrase in and of itself may be valid in certain contexts, its application as a means of dismissing dissent or justifying [[Fallacy|fallacious logic]] is what makes it thought-terminating.

The term was popularized by [[Robert Jay Lifton]] in his 1956 book ''[[Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism]]''. Lifton said, “The language of the totalist environment is characterized by the thought-terminating cliché. The most far-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed. These become the start and finish of any ideological analysis.” <ref name="cliche">{{cite book |last=Lifton |first=Robert J. |title=Thought reform and the psychology of totalism: A study of brainwashing in China |page=429 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FU_ifHrIIg0C&pg=PA429&dq=%22Thought-terminating+clich%C3%A9%22+totalism&ei=36VxS9WhBZLKMObN7PkF&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false |year=1989 |publisher=[[UNC Press]]|isbn=9780807842539}}</ref><ref>[http://www.watchman.org/cults/usemindcontrol2.htm The Watchman Expositor: The use of Mind Control in Religious Cults (Part Two)]</ref> 

In [[George Orwell|George Orwell’s]] novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', the fictional constructed language [[Newspeak]] is designed to reduce language entirely to a set of thought-terminating clichés. [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley’s]] ''[[Brave New World]]'' society uses thought-terminating clichés in a more conventional manner, most notably in regard to the drug ''[[Soma (Brave New World)|soma]]'' as well as modified versions of real-life platitudes, such as, “A doctor a day keeps the jim-jams away.”

== Political examples ==

<!-- Please do not add current examples without citing a reliable source (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources); avoid recentism and needless coatracking controversy. -->
Thought-terminating clichés are sometimes used during political discourse to enhance appeal or to shut down debate. In this setting, their usage can usually be classified as a logical fallacy.{{Citation needed|reason=This seems reasonable, but I'd like to see it cited as well as places where the items on the list below are recognized by an expert as being thought-terminating clichés - [[User:BrotherE|BrotherE]] ([[User talk:BrotherE|talk]])|date=November 2008}}

* "Opposition at any cost!" ([[Bare assertion fallacy]])
* "That’s just a (liberal/conservative/libertarian/communitarian/etc.) argument." ([[Association fallacy]]).
* "[[Socialisme ou Barbarie|Socialism or barbarism]]!" ([[False dichotomy]])
* "'Anarchist organisations', isn't that an oxymoron?" ([[Equivocation]])
* "Love it or leave it." ([[False dichotomy]])
* "[[Fascist (epithet)|Fascist]] arguments need no comments." ([[Weasel words]])
* "You're either with us, or against us."
* "Political correctness" or "PC"
* "It's political correctness gone mad!"
* "It's for the good of the public."
* "One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter"

==Religious examples== 

Thought-terminating clichés are also present in religious
discourse in order to define a clear border between good and evil, holiness and
sacrilege, and other polar opposites.{{Citation needed|reason=This seems
reasonable, but I'd like to see it cited as well as places where the items on
the list below are recognized by an expert as being thought-terminating
clichés|date=November 2008}} These are especially present in religious
literature.{{Citation needed|reason=That thought-terminating clichés are more
prevalent in religious literature than in other areas of life is a claim that
needs specific support|date=November 2008}}

* "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away." {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Job|chapter=1|verse=21}}
* "[[Adam and Eve]], not [[Adam and Steve]]!" (opposing [[same-sex marriage]])
* "That's not [[Biblical]]."
* "God moves/works in mysterious ways."
* "God never gives you more suffering than you can bear.”
* "Only God can judge."
* "God has a plan."
* "The Lord works in mysterious ways."

The religious or semi-religious ideas of [[cult]]s, [[heresy|heretics]], and
[[infidel]]s are also often used as thought-terminating clichés, e.g. "Do not
listen to him, he is an infidel," (a [[guilt by association]] fallacy) or "That
line of thought sounds like a cult" (also a guilt by association fallacy).

== As an autological phrase ==

The statement "that is a thought-terminating cliché" can itself function as a
thought-terminating cliché. Once the stator has identified a first statement as
a thought-terminating cliché, they may feel absolved of needing to determine
whether that first statement is indeed a thought-terminating cliché, or provides
useful insight, in the context under discussion.
